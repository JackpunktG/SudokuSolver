# Sudoku Solver

Im back at it with a sudoku solver!! Whilst I get to know my way around C#!!

### Updates

Added pair logic to guess and check the results - can now even get some trickier solve

##### to come

- Streamline and tidy up the code... as it looks like a mess
- ~~Quadrant pairs~~
- improved user inputs and testing. 

Much love <3
