# Sudoku Solver

Im back at it with a sudoku solver!! Whilst I get to know my way around C#!!

### Updates

- Added pair logic to guess and check the results - can now even get some trickier solve 
- Now this user inputs!! Test your sudokus today, with error handling whilst inputing for ease of use :)

##### to come

- Streamline and optimise the code
- guessing for triples to enable harder solves
- ~~Quadrant pairs~~
- improved user inputs and testing. 
- sudoku builder??

Much love <3
