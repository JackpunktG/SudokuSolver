# Sudoku Solver

Im back at it with a sudoku solver!! Whilst I get to know my way around C#

### Updates

- Added pairing logic to solve all sudokus
- Also checks inputs of valid Sudoku Puzzle
- Contradiction test to stop branches that lead to unsolvable, forever looping, states
- Now this user inputs!! Test your sudokus today, with error handling whilst inputing for ease of use :)

##### to come

- Streamline and optimise the code
- ~~guessing branching logic to enable all sudokus to be solved~~
- improved user inputs and testing. 
- sudoku builder??

Much love <3
